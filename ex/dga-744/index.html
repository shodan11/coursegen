  <dt>5/01:  Projects due 05/14</dt>
    <dd>Project writeups are due 05/14 to make sure we have a few days to grade them before CSD black friday.  Please disregard the earlier due date of 05/09.</dd>
  <dt>4/16:  Tools homework 2 update</dt>
    <dd>If you haven't done part of of hw2 yet, we suggest pinging the host <tt>eep.lcs.mit.edu</tt> instead of <tt>www.cs.cmu.edu</tt>.  www.cs seems to have a per-host IP ID counter, so it worked in the tests we ran from a single machine, but doesn't work when pinging from two hosts.</dd>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
15-744 is a graduate course in computer networks.  The goals are:
<ul>
 <li>To understand the state of the art in network protocols, network architecture, and networked systems.</li>
 <li>To understand how to engage in networking research.</li>
 <li>To investigate novel ideas in networking through a semester-long research project.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The past few years have seen a remarkable growth in the global
network infrastructure. The Internet has grown from a research
curiosity to something we all take for granted.
</p>
<p>
How does this network infrastructure work?  What are the design principles
upon which it is based, and how are those principles applied in practice?
How can we make the Internet work better today?  We will examine these
issues and more during the course.
</p>

<p>
This course assumes a basic familiarity with networking concepts.
The course will consist of a reading/lecture/discussion component
and a project component. The class will cover approximately 50
research papers on various aspects of computer networking. These
papers will introduce students to the basic design principles on
which today's networks are based. In addition, these papers will
cover recent proposals to improve network performance, functionality
and scalability. Specific topics that will be covered include:
LAN/WAN technologies, congestion/flow control, traffic analysis,
routing, internetworking, multicast, security, and quality of
service. Students are expected to read papers before the class and
participate in the discussion during the class.
