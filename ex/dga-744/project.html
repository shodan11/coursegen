<p>Projects should be done in groups of three.
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Project proposals are due on 02/14.  These should be a few pages
that succinctly describe what you plan to work on, a rough timeline,
and a bit of the related work in the area.
</li>
<li>Project writeups are due 5/14 at 5pm.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Project Management</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="ideas/index.html">Project ideas</a> (CMU only)</li>
</ul>

<p>
You should strongly consider using either
 <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/">Subversion</a> or
 <a href="http://cvsbook.red-bean.com/">CVS</a>
 to perform source code control for your project and the paper
 you write describing it.  I suggest Subversion.
 </p>

 <p>I also strongly suggest writing your course project report using
  <a
  href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0201529831/104-3940833-1361514?v=glance">LaTeX</a>.
  It is the de-facto tool in which most CS research papers are written.
  While it has a bit of start up cost, it's <i>much</i> easier to
  collaboratively write complex research papers using LaTeX than using
  word.</p>

<h2>Writing Papers</h2>


<ul>
<li><a href="sample.tar.gz">Sample LaTeX paper (tar.gz)</a></li>
<li><a href="writing-papers.ps">An Evaluation of the Ninth SOSP Submissions - or
 - How (and How Not) to Write a Good Systems Paper</a> 
    by Roy Levin and David D. Redell</li>
<li><a href="http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/mleone/web/how-to.html"
>Collected resources about writing and research</a>
</ul>


<h2>Simulation</h2>

<p>The most popular network simulators are <a
href="http://www.isi.edu/nsnam/ns/">ns-2</a> and <a
href="http://www.opnet.com/products/networkr&amp;d/home.html">Opnet</a>.
ns-2 is free, and CSD has some licenses for Opnet.  </p>

<h2>Testbeds and Emulation</h2>
<h3>Emulab</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.emulab.net/">Emulab</a> is a network emulation environment
at the University of Utah.  It provides racks of machines and programmable
switches that can be configured to form mostly-arbitrary network topologies,
with controllable delay and loss between nodes.  It's a great way to test
real programs in repeatable conditions or at scales that you can't get on
your own.
<p>
Emulab also provides a set of wireless nodes that you can control,
located around their building.  They also have an experimental mobile
robot testbed that could make for fun projects (the robots are designed
to move computers and radios around so that you can do repeatable experiments
involving mobility).
</p>
<ul>
<li>If you wish to use Emulab for your project, you should <a href="https:/
/www.emulab.net/joinproject.php3?target_pid=cmu849">join our class emulab
project</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The RON Testbed</h3>
The RON testbed is a 37-node distributed Internet testbed.  The nodes 
are mostly US centric, but some are located around the globe.
The machines can be used for network measurements or for evaluating
your projects.  They're managed through Emulab.
The RON testbed is similar to, but smaller than...

<h3>Planetlab</h3>
<a href="http://www.planet-lab.org/">PlanetLab</a> is a large-scale,
distributed collection of machines that can be used for experiments
and measurements.  It has about 594 nodes scattered over 282 sites.
The machines run something linux-ish that you can login to and
run programs, and there exist a variety of utilities for automatically
distributing software to the nodes, running programs, and so on.
<p>
You must sign up to use a PlanetLab account.  Please only sign up if
you're going to use the account, since it imposes some management
overhead on people not involved with the course.

<h3>Wireless Nodes</h3>
<p>

Dave and some of the other faculty have a handful of various wireless
nodes, cards, old laptops, etc., available that you may be able to use
for your projects.
</p>

<h3>moteLab</h3>
<p>
<a href="http://motelab.eecs.harvard.edu/">moteLab</a> is a wireless sensor
network deployed in the CS building at Harvard.  It has 30 sensor
motes that users can upload system images to, collect data from, etc.
To use moteLab, you'll need to send them an email (listed on their
web page).  Please CC: dga on the mail.
</p>

<h3>MistLab</h3>
<p>
<a href="http://mistlab.csail.mit.edu">Mistlab</a>
 is a wireless testbed with 60 Mica2/Cricket nodes
(sensor boards, much like the motes in moteLab) distributed over the
9th floor in the Stata center at
MIT's Computer Science and AI Lab.  For access, see their web
page and send them an email, and please CC: dga on the mail.
</p>

<h2>Routing</h2>
<ul>
 <li><a href="http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/click/">The Click Modular Router</a></li>
 <li><a href="http://www.xorp.org/">XORP</a> the eXtensible Open Router Platform</a></li>
 <li><a href="http://www.quagga.net/">Quagga</a> - an open source routing suite</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Measurement</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Scriptroute (note: runs well on planetlab and the RON testbed)</li>
</ul>
 
<h2>Analysis</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Books:  Raj Jain, the Art of Computer Systems Performance Analysis - a very good overview of lots of mathetmatical techniques and queueing bits, aimed at a systems audience</li>
</ul>
