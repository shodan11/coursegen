<ul class="announcements">

  <li><b>5/01:  Projects due 05/14</b> <br />
    Project writeups are due 05/14 to make sure we have a few days to grade them before CSD black friday.  Please disregard the earlier due date of 05/09.<br /></li>
  <li><b>4/16:  Tools homework 2 update</b> <br />
    If you haven't done part of of hw2 yet, we suggest pinging the host <tt>eep.lcs.mit.edu</tt> instead of <tt>www.cs.cmu.edu</tt>.  www.cs seems to have a per-host IP ID counter, so it worked in the tests we ran from a single machine, but doesn't work when pinging from two hosts.<br /></li>
  <li><b>4/9:  Tools homework 2 online</b> <br />
    The second tools homework is now online.  Note that scriptroute does not want to compile on andrew linux machines.  Use either your own or a CS linux machine if you have problems.<br /></li>
  <li><b>4/1:  Syllabus updated</b> <br />
    The rest of the semester is filled in.<br /></li>
  <li><b>3/19:  midterm and ps2 solutions</b> <br />
    Midterm and problem set 2 solutions have been posted. (If you have not already, you can pick up your HWs and midterms from Jeff.)<br /></li>
  <li><b>3/18:  scheduling project meetings</b> <br />
    Please contact Barbara Gardillo, the course secretary, with the times your group can meet <b>next</b> Wednesday (<tt>bag AT cs DOT cmu DOT edu</tt>).<br /></li>
